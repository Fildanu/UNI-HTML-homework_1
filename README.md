Homework for university - basic HTML website about the city Bergamo

# 🌆 City Website Project

This is a **university project** created **entirely using HTML**.  
The goal of the project is to practice the basic structure of web development — creating and linking multiple pages, using lists, images, and HTML forms.

## 🏙️ Project Overview

The website contains 24 pages, all sharing a similar layout and navigation menu.
